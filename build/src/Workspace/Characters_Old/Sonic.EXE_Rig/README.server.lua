-- What you're seeing is likely the LAST Sonic.EXE: The Disaster-themed model I will ever make! (Confident, I know. Shouldn't count on it, might get dragged back in someday)

-- Throughout my time i've seen an increase in people with...QUESTIONABLE talent, to say the least, using other creator's works and assets without explicit permission, in an
-- attempt to make their own up-and-coming Sonic.EXE game. I know, you're probably saying, "Well Splonk, they're kids" and to that I say...Yes!

-- ...

-- If you're a developer looking to make their own assets, but you're looking to take notes of how this rig is built...Well first off, this probably isn't the best example,
-- but more importantly, you're more than welcome to look through.

-- I decided to upload this rig as a sort of 'safety blanket' for upcoming developers to use. No malicious scripts (it would be funny, but I am NOT script-savvy enough to do that)
-- just the rig in it's most basic state, being a close 1:1 recreation attempt of the Sonic.EXE model from Sonic.EXE: The Disaster 1.2 Alpha. All parts of this model are built
-- from the ground up (with the help of reference images, the amount of images I had to swift through was painful)

-- It should go without saying but I DO NOT have any affiliation with games that utilise this model. Frankly, that should be glaringly obvious, as this is a public toolbox
-- item and shouldn't reflect my brand in ANY WAY (I know what some of you weirdos do with these models. Good grief, get a hobby)

-- In all seriousness, I wanted to give back to the community that i've "MOSTLY" tolerated, and have given me a space to practice and improve my modelling skills to something I
-- could only dream of before.

-- Should be pretty self-explanatory, if you know how to setup this kinda stuff. Rename the model to "StarterCharacter" and drop 'em in the StarterPlayer folder. 'nuff said

-- Thank you,

- Splonk :]
